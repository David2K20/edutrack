### Frontend  
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and visually appealing design.  
- **JavaScript**  

### Database

- **MySQL** support available (Database Name: `sql_edutrack`)

---

## Prerequisites  

Before setting up the application, ensure you have the following tools and technologies installed on your system:  
- **Python** (v3.8 or higher): Download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
- **MySQL**: Install and configure MySQL, ensuring a database named `sql_edutrack` is created.  
- **pip**: Python's package manager, included with Python installations.  
- **Virtual Environment Manager** (e.g., `venv` or `virtualenv`): Optional but recommended for dependency isolation.  
- **Git**: For cloning the project repository.

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
```

#### For Mac 

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

### Acivate Virtual Environment

#### For Windows 

```bash

```

#### Then, Enter the project

```bash
$ cd Django-Student-Mangement-System
```

### 4. Configure the Database
- Go to the settings.py file
- Ensure the database named **sql_edutrack** is created in MySQL. Modify the DATABASES section as follows:

```bash
DATABASES = {  
    'default': {  
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',  
        'NAME': 'sql_edutrack',  
        'USER': 'your-mysql-username',

$ python manage.py makemigrations  
```

```bash
$ python manage.py migrate  
```

### 6. Create a Superuser

```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser  
```

### 7. Run the Development server

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

## Render Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment on Render with hardcoded database values.

### Features for Render:
- **Hardcoded SQLite Database**: Uses SQLite database that persists with the deployment
- **Static Files**: Configured with WhiteNoise for serving static files
- **Production Settings**: Optimized settings for production deployment
- **Build Script**: Automated build process with `build.sh`

### Deployment Steps:
1. Fork this repository or push your code to a Git repository
2. Connect your repository to Render
3. Create a new Web Service on Render
4. Use the following settings:
   - **Build Command**: `./build.sh`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT django_project.wsgi:application`
   - **Environment**: Python 3.11.0
5. The `render.yaml` file will automatically configure the deployment

### Environment Variables:
- **SECRET_KEY**: Auto-generated by Render (configured in render.yaml)
- **PYTHON_VERSION**: Set to 3.11.0

### Important Files for Render:
- `render.yaml`: Service configuration
- `build.sh`: Build script
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `runtime.txt`: Python version specification
